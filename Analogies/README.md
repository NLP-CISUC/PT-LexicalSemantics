# TAP

TAP, acronym for the Portuguese name "Teste de Analogias em PortuguÃªs", is and adaptation of the <a href="https://github.com/nathanshartmann/portuguese_word_embeddings/blob/master/analogies/testset/LX-4WAnalogies.txt">LX-4WAnalogiesPT </a> dataset, which is a Portuguese translation of the Google Analogy Test.

The main difference is that TAP is organised similarly to the Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS, http://vecto.space/data/):
* Several files, each targeting a different relation.
* Duplica pairs of words removed.

This enables the assessment of word embeddings in the Vecto framework.
