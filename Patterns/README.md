Patterns indicating lexico-semantic relations in Portuguese, to be used in BERT (Masked Language Modelling) or GPT (Text Completion) models for discovering related arguments:

* Relations names are those covered in TALES.
* Before usage, <r> is to be replaced by a word.
* In BERT, arguments will be predicted for the [MASK] token.
* In GPT-2, the pattern will be automatically completed, and it is up to the programmer to select the argument.
  
BERT patterns were used in a paper to be published in the 15th International Conference on Computational Processing of Portuguese (PROPOR 2022):
