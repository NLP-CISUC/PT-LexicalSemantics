# TALES

TALES, acronym for the Portuguese name "Teste de Analogias LÉxico-Semânticas", is an analogy-like test with lexical-semantic relations for assessing Portuguese word embeddings.

It is organised similarly to the Bigger Analogy Test Set (BATS, http://vecto.space/data/):
* Several files, each targeting a different relation, with 50 "questions" in each.
* A question correspondents to the first argument of a relation a, followed by possible second arguments a', split by /.

Instances of lexical-semantic relations were acquired from a large Portuguese LKB (https://github.com/hgoliv/PT-LexicalSemantics/tree/master/Relations).
